# NEXT
- tests
- think how to deal/manage with clients from CRM
- add a pagination for lists
- think about database (SQLite usage?)
- docummentation of api (pip install drf-yasg)
- think about deep machine learning
- deploy api online

12/10/2024
- api/procedures asking for authentication token with (permission_classes)
- api/procedures GET to list procedures (empty body wil return list)
- api/procedures for POST to create procedure (body below)
{
    "id": 41,
    "name": "TESTE",
    "description": "TESTE MESMO",
    "cost": 999.0,
    "duration": 15,
    "expiration": 40,
    "region": "TESTE",
    "complaint": "Linhas de TESTE, TESTE"
}
- api/procedures for UPDATE to update procedures (all fields or only specific data)
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/procedures/<procedure_id>/ with body:
{
  "name": "Updated Procedure Name",
  "description": "Updated description for the procedure.",
  "cost": 999,
  "region": "Updated Region",
  "complaint": "Updated complaint",
  "duration": 30,
  "expiration": 60
}

- api/procedures for DELETE to delete procedure
DELETE reqeust to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/procedures/<procedure_id>/
empty body

- ViewSet is amazing because it automatically generate CRUD endpoints

- set up api/appointments/recommended/
class ServedAppointmentsViewSet
action within it with "def recommend" triggering recommendation engine
request to this url didn't work:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/procedures/recommended/

13/10
- splitting Appointments from procedures
 procedures>url>routes>import appointments.views ServedAppointmentsViewSet 
ViewSet is imported from the class I created

14/10
- splitting recommendations from appointments and procedures
- update URLs at endpoint api/procedures/ and api/recommend/
- check why only 1 recommendation and then it dies
- algorithm.py for data prep(json) and recommendation logic
- views method "recommend" as entrypoint for the API receiving procedures and applying logic

to-dos
1 - deal with extra '/' at URL
2 - create a permmanent token for 'luis' user
option 1: do it via JWT that we already have
option 2
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # Other apps
    'rest_framework.authtoken',
]
python manage.py shell
use "Authorization: Token <your_token>" on requests

3 - log db to save received requests with the appointment payload data for training
	1.	Create a RequestLog model:
	2.	Log the Request in the View:

4 - think about performance optimization - response times? big volume of requests
5 - add more detailed messages during error handling

Samir
- this model of preparing the procedures and just sending back would work?
- graphQLProCorpo component to GET retrieve "purchases", "leads messages" and "follow ups"
